# Schedulify Developer Guide

This guide provides in-depth technical information for developers who want to contribute to the Schedulify project.

## Project Structure

The Schedulify project is a monorepo managed with npm workspaces. The `packages` directory contains the two main projects:

*   `client`: The React frontend application.
*   `server`: The Node.js backend application.

### Client

The client is a React application built with Create React App and TypeScript. It uses Material-UI for the component library and FullCalendar for the booking calendar.

*   `src/components`: Contains the React components.
*   `src/contexts`: Contains the React contexts.
*   `src/themes`: Contains the theme files.

### Server

The server is a Node.js application built with Express and TypeScript. It uses Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database and Passport.js for authentication.

*   `src/controllers`: Contains the route handlers.
*   `src/models`: Contains the Mongoose models.
*   `src/routes`: Contains the Express routes.
*   `src/middleware`: Contains the Express middleware.
*   `src/plugins`: Contains the plugin system.
*   `src/config`: Contains configuration files.

## API

The Schedulify API is a RESTful API that uses JSON for communication. The API is documented using OpenAPI (Swagger), and the documentation can be generated by running the following command:

```bash
npm run swagger
```

This will generate a `swagger.json` file in the `packages/server/dist` directory. You can then use a tool like Swagger UI to view the documentation.

## Plugins

The Schedulify plugin system allows you to extend the functionality of the CMS without modifying the core code. A plugin is a self-contained module that can add new routes, models, and views to the application.

Please refer to the `docs/THEME_DEVELOPMENT.md` for an example of how to create a plugin.

## Testing

The Schedulify project uses Jest and Supertest for backend testing and React Testing Library for frontend testing.

To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run backend tests
cd packages/server
npm test

# Run frontend tests
cd packages/client
npm test
```
